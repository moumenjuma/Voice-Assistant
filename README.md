Project Summary: Voice Assistant "Cyrus"
---------------------------------------
This is a C# Windows Forms application that functions as a voice assistant, likely named Cyrus. Here‚Äôs what it includes:

Key Features & Components

    Voice Recognition:
      Uses System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine to listen and interpret voice commands.

    Speech Synthesis (Text-to-Speech):
      Uses SpeechSynthesizer to respond verbally to user commands.

    Graphical User Interface:
      Built using Windows Forms (Form1.cs), allowing interaction through a GUI.

    Web Automation Capabilities:
      Imports OpenQA.Selenium and OpenQA.Selenium.Chrome, indicating it can use Selenium to control a 
      web browser (e.g., open sites, search the web).
  
    Command Configuration:
      Likely reads commands from Commands.txt to determine how to respond to specific inputs.
